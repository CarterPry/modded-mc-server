## Modded CurseForge MC Server
This is a server a friend and I setup and played through with about 112 mods. I hosted it from a linux server and we used (CurseForge)[https://www.curseforge.com/] on the client side to play it.
Download and upload this (file)[https://github.com/CarterPry/modded-mc-server/blob/main/UploadThistoCurseForgeForClientSideModsToPlay.zip] to curseforge for a profile that is compatable with the mods being used.

This is a list of all the mods that are used on the server (There are more client side mods on profile that just makes things easier)

To run the command on a linux terminal you can do so with the command
 sudo java -Xmx[Amount of Ram you want to use] -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2859.jar nogui 
For example I used 14G of Ram so this was my command
 sudo java -Xmx14G -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2859.jar nogui -Dfml.queryResult=confirm
